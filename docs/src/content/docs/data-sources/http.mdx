## Background

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. A REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data over the internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It defines a standardized way for clients (e.g., web browsers or other software) to make requests to a server (e.g., a web server or a remote service) and receive responses in a structured format, typically in JSON or XML. 

HTTP APIs are commonly used to enable functionality like retrieving data from a server, updating resources, or performing various operations within web and mobile applications. They are a key component of modern web development and facilitate interoperability between different systems and services.
