An Internet of Things (IoT) gateway is a crucial component in IoT architectures that facilitates communication between devices at the edge of the network and the central or cloud-based platform.
Device Management is a required solution that enables organisations to oversee the entire lifecycle of their IoT devices. It involves overseeing the entire lifecycle of IoT devices, from initial provisioning and configuration to ongoing monitoring, updates, maintenance and decommissioning. 

# Types of available gateways
1. **Edge Gateways** – These gateways are edge computing devices running an operating system. Linux is a popular choice of OS for such gateways. Such gateways are managed remotely using automated scripts and metric exporters. 
3. **Semi Open Gateways** – These gateways are custom built and come with a SDK. The hardware and the custom logic programming are supported by the manufacturer. Gateway management is also provided by the manufacturer.  
4. **Closed Gateways** – These gateways do not have a user programmable controller. A custom service is required to connect to such gateways. 

From an organisation's point of view, a combination of such gateways are deployed on field. Hence a superset device management solution is required to effectively manage these devices.

## Features of device management
1. **Device Discovery and Onboarding:** Simplified and secure methods to add new IoT devices to the network. This ensures that devices are authenticated and authorised to join the network.
2. **Monitoring and Diagnostics:** Real-time monitoring of device health and performance metrics, such as connectivity status, location, battery levels, and sensor data. The ability to perform remote diagnostics and troubleshooting is crucial for efficient device management. 
3. **Configuration Management:** Centralised management of device configurations, allowing administrators to remotely configure settings, update firmware, and manage device behaviour.
4. **Firmware (OTA) Updates and Patch Management:** Secure and reliable mechanisms to deploy firmware updates and security patches to IoT devices. This ensures that devices remain up-to-date with the latest features and security enhancements.
5. **Security and Encryption:** Manage credentials and certificates used to authenticate and authorise traffic flowing form the devices.
6. **Alerts and Notifications:** Proactive alerts and notifications to administrators and users for important events, such as device failures, security breaches, or abnormal behaviour.
7. **Integration with Existing Systems:** Integration capabilities with existing enterprise systems, such as IoT platforms, analytics tools, and cloud services, to leverage data insights and improve decision-making.
8. **Identity and Access Management:** Robust authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorised users and devices can access the IoT infrastructure and services. This involves managing device identities, user credentials, and role-based access.
9. **Device Warranty Management**: Manage device lifecycle and notify relevant stake holder regarding device warranty and service subscriptions. 
10. **Device Decommissioning:** Proper procedures for securely decommissioning devices from the network when they are no longer needed or are replaced by newer versions.
