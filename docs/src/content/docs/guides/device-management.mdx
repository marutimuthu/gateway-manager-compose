Device Management is a required solution that enables organisations to oversee the entire lifecycle of their IoT devices. It involves overseeing the entire lifecycle of IoT devices, from initial provisioning and configuration to ongoing monitoring, updates, maintenance and decommissioning.

#### Classifcation of IIoT devices based on programming & integration:
<Image src={Image2} alt="A description of my image." /> 

1. **Proprietory IoT Gateways** 
    - These gateways do not have a user programmable controller.
    - Gateway management is provided by the manufacturer.
    - E.g. Teltonika
2. **Semi Open Gateways** 
    - These gateways are custom built and come with a SDK. 
    - The hardware and the custom logic programming are supported by the manufacturer. 
    - Gateway management is provided by the manufacturer.
    - E.g. Logic IO
3. **Edge Gateways**
    - These gateways are capable of running containers. 
    - Linux is a popular choice of OS for such gateways. 
    - Such gateways are managed remotely using automated scripts and metric exporters. 
    - E.g. Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson
4. **Open Source IoT Gateways** 
    - These gateways are open source and source code is available freely
    - They are low cost and is popular amongst the developer community
    - These gateways do not have inbuilt security and device management capabilities
    - E.g. QUECTEL / SIMCOM / ESP32 based IoT gateways


### ⭐️ Device management features
1. **Device Discovery and Onboarding:** Simplified and secure methods to add new IoT devices to the network. This ensures that devices are authenticated and authorised to join the network.
1. **Configuration Management:** Centralised management of device configurations, allowing administrators to remotely configure settings, update firmware, and manage device behaviour.
1. **Monitoring and Diagnostics:** Real-time monitoring of device health and performance metrics, such as connectivity status, location, battery levels, and sensor data. The ability to perform remote diagnostics and troubleshooting is crucial for efficient device management. 
1. **Firmware (OTA) Updates and Patch Management:** Secure and reliable mechanisms to deploy firmware updates and security patches to IoT devices. This ensures that devices remain up-to-date with the latest features and security enhancements.
1. **Identity and Access Management:** Robust authentication and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorised users and devices can access the IoT infrastructure and services. This involves managing device identities, user credentials, and role-based access.
1. **Alerts and Notifications:** Proactive alerts and notifications to administrators and users for important events, such as device failures, security breaches, or abnormal behaviour.
1. **Integration with Existing Systems:** Integration capabilities with existing enterprise systems, such as IoT platforms, analytics tools, and cloud services, to leverage data insights and improve decision-making.
1. **Security and Encryption:** Manage credentials and certificates used to authenticate and authorise traffic flowing form the devices.
1. **Device Warranty Management**: Manage device lifecycle and notify relevant stake holder regarding device warranty and service subscriptions. 
1. **Device Decommissioning:** Proper procedures for securely decommissioning devices from the network when they are no longer needed or are replaced by newer versions.
