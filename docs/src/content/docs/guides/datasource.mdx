- Data Source Config: Configuration of the data source from which data will be collected.
- Data Address: The address or location of the data source.
- Raw Data: The initial, unprocessed data collected from the source.
- Filter: A process where the raw data is filtered to remove unwanted information or to focus on specific data points.
- Transform: Transformation of the filtered data into a suitable format or structure for further processing.
- Processed Data: The data after it has been filtered and transformed.
- Notify: A process that sends notifications about the processed data.
- Hot Store: Storage of processed data in a system that allows for quick access and retrieval.
- Publish to UNS: The process of publishing the processed data to an UNS (unified namespace).
- Aggregate: Aggregation of data from the hot store, potentially summarizing or combining it for further analysis.
- Cold Store: Long-term storage of aggregated data, typically less expensive and slower to access compared to hot storage.
