In order to make the shift to Industry 4.0, the three 'M's of manufacturing; Man (Humans), Machines and Material, must posses the abilty to store data, apply intelligence to it and take action. Currently only humans posses all these three abilities. 

With the rapid advancements in internet and technologies surrounding it, it is now possible to maintain realtime communication with the machines and create a virtual machine mind (digital twin) on the cloud.

Data exists either in digital or analogue form and are exhanged between machines using communication protocols. It is the duty of **IoT Devices** to convert protocols and send it to the **Edge or Cloud** to store data, apply intelligence and take action on it. 

Managing Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices involves several complex challenges due to the unique demands and environments of industrial settings.

This platform is built to manage these IIoT devices and bring the industrial field communications to the edge and then to the cloud.
